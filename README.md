# Lem_in
Lem_in is a School 21 (Ecole 42) project.

The purpose of the project is to find the shortests paths in a graph to move ants from start room to end room with the least number of steps.Ants will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.
All solutions involve rigorous input validation and algorithmic optimization.
